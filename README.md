# catapi-android
Just a small project to learn how does dependency injection and other frameworks work within Android, the idea came from the pair programming excercise at @Nearsoft for the Android developers that want to join the flock.

Using almost everything from square io to build this.

Basically the idea is to create an app where you can save/favorite some random cat images from the internet.
